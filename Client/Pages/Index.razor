                        <p>
                            I took my first computer science lesson in year 10 at school in 2015,
                            it was covering C# where we made a average speed camera application written in a .NET Framework console application.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have now been programming in .NET and C# for @YearsProgramming years. I have used C# through sixth form, university and in my job.</p>

                        <p>
                            I have worked on some great projects that have included using C# & .NET, my first job at BAE Systems where I started working in 2017,
                            where I worked on great projects to provide software to aid pilot training, for many air forces around the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>This included make libaries in C#, making large applications in WPF and web applications in ASP.NET CORE.</p>
